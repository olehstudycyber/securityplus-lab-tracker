# 🧪 Cybersecurity Home Lab & Security+ Tracker

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity lab project! This GitHub repository documents my hands-on learning journey as I prepare for the **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)** certification.

## 🔐 About This Lab
I'm building and simulating real-world security scenarios in a **physical home lab** environment to:
- Practice penetration testing and threat detection
- Gain hands-on experience with security tools and techniques
- Reinforce Security+ exam objectives
- Document and showcase my skills to potential employers
