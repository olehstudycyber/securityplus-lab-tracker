üí° **Tip:** Aim for 85‚Äì90% on practice tests before booking your exam.
# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Home Lab - Isolated Network Setup Progress

## Goal
Establish a functional isolated lab network environment for penetration testing, consisting of:
- **Windows Server 2025** (Target Machine)
- **Kali Linux** (Attacker Machine)
- **Windows 7 Virtual Machine** (Secondary Target for Multi-Host Attack Simulation)

All systems operate on a dedicated **192.168.1.0/24 subnet** via a **Netgear router**, with no internet exposure.

---

## Key Steps Completed

### üõßÔ∏è 1. Network Setup Verification
- Physical machines (**Windows Server 2025** and **Kali Linux**) successfully connected to the Netgear router.
- Verified correct IP address assignment on the **192.168.1.0/24** network.

---

### üñ•Ô∏è 2. Bridging the Windows 7 VM (VirtualBox)
- Configured VM network adapter:
  - Mode: **Bridged Adapter**
  - Interface: **Realtek Gaming 2.5GbE Family Controller**
- Initial Issue:  
  - Windows 7 VM received **APIPA address** (169.254.x.x), indicating DHCP failure.
- Resolution:  
  - Verified physical Ethernet connection from Windows 11 host to router.
  - Confirmed proper network adapter selected in VirtualBox settings.
  - **Rebooted** Windows 11 host ‚Äî Windows 7 VM then successfully obtained a DHCP IP address within the **192.168.1.0/24** subnet.

---

### üåê 3. Verifying Network Connectivity
- Inside the Windows 7 VM:
  - Ran `ipconfig` to confirm valid IP assignment (e.g., 192.168.1.3).
- From Kali Linux:
  - Ran `nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24` to discover live hosts.
  - Successfully identified the Windows 7 VM on the network.

---

### üîé 4. Scanning the Windows 7 VM with Nmap
- Full TCP port scan:
  ```
  sudo nmap -sV -p- 192.168.1.3
  ```
  - Only **port 1716** reported as open (tcpwrapped).

- Targeted scan for common Windows ports:
  ```
  sudo nmap -sV -p 135,445,3389 192.168.1.3
  ```
  - No additional open ports found.

---

### üî• 5. Troubleshooting Blocked Ports
- Identified **Windows Firewall** on the Windows 7 VM likely blocking incoming traffic.
- Discussed two options:
  - **Disable Windows Firewall** temporarily (faster testing for isolated labs).
  - **Create specific Inbound Rules** to allow traffic on selected ports (real-world best practice).

---

## üßπ Current Status
- **Network connectivity** between Kali, Windows Server 2025, and Windows 7 VM is confirmed.
- **Open ports and services** on Windows 7 VM are currently restricted by firewall settings.
- Next steps involve:
  - Adjusting Windows Firewall settings.
  - Verifying key services (`services.msc`) like:
    - **File and Printer Sharing**
    - **Remote Desktop Services**
  - Using `netstat -ano` to confirm listening ports.

---

# üöÄ Next Actions
- Configure Windows 7 firewall rules to open desired ports (135, 445, 3389).
- Validate services are running and reachable for exploitation or lateral movement simulations.

---

> ‚úÖ **Lab connectivity established. Vulnerability exposure and service hardening testing next phase ready.**

## üîö Notes

This tracker will be updated regularly as I advance through projects, attacks, defense, and study objectives. It's part of my portfolio toward landing a cybersecurity analyst role.
